# quick-installation-scripts
Scripts for quickly installing and configuring software into a usable state.

The Node.js quick installer (NodejsTDD_QuickInstall.sh) is a script for installing and configuring Node.js, Mocha, and NPM to a point where Test Driven Development can be performed immediately. Some simple code is automatically generated, which should pass as 'green' as soon as an npm test command is executed by the developer. A project folder is created and named as specified by the developer during the installation process.
